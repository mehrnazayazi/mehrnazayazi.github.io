                        Hi! I'm Mehrnaz (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQGlkw83aLs">how to pronounce my first name</a> - 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEgWsYemkRM">how to pronounce my last name</a>). 
                        I'm a computer science student at UC Riverside. I earned my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran, in 2019. 
                        I have a passion for solving puzzles, love math, and have a keen interest in theoretical computer science and computer graphics. Recently, I worked on a fluid stylization problem based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00803">Lagrangian Neural Style Transfer</a>, 
                        which sparked my curiosity about machine learning, convolutional networks, their underlying mechanics, and their potential applications.
                        <br /><br />
                        In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, running, swimming, watching philosophy videos on YouTube, exploring French New Wave films, and learning new languages—both natural and programming. 
                        I'm enthusiastic about community involvement and sharing my experiences. As a result, I have served as a mentor for international students at UCR and as the president of the Graduate Student Association 
                        in the Computer Science and Engineering department during the 2023-2024 academic year.

                    <p>
                        I am deeply  <strong>passionate about research</strong> and aspire to continue my career in this field, engaging with <strong>both theoretical and practical problems</strong> .My fascination with theoretical challenges began early in life when I found joy in discovering patterns in numbers during primary school. 
                        This passion grew through my participation in math Olympiad classes in high school. Although I couldn’t always dedicate as much time as I wanted to these problems, the thrill of thinking through a complex issue for hours brought me immense satisfaction. 
                        Throughout my undergraduate studies, I consistently pursued math and theoretical courses, maintaining my love for theoretical work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up with an engineer father who preferred building solutions rather than consuming them, I developed a strong inclination for practical problem-solving. <strong>This blend of theoretical interest and hands-on problem-solving drives my approach: I thrive on the joy of finding solutions</strong>.
                         I was initially drawn to <strong>computer graphics due to its rich use of mathematics, physics, and scientific computing</strong>. However, my internships at DreamWorks exposed me to another compelling aspect of this field—the <strong>intersection of computer science and art</strong>. 
                         This blend of technical and artistic elements captivated me even more. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As <strong>machine learning</strong> gained prominence, it piqued my curiosity as well. Working on a project that used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to transfer styles to fluid simulations motivated me to explore machine learning further. 
                        <strong>I wanted to understand this field deeply and make informed decisions about its applications across various domains</strong>.
                        If I were to summarize my interests, I would say I have a <strong> broad passion for theoretical computer science, with a particular fascination for interdisciplinary work</strong>, especially in fields intersecting with art and the humanities. 
                        I find it incredibly rewarding to apply computer science and quantitative methods in these areas, as they allow me to see the tangible impact of my work in meaningful and creative ways.                    </p>

                        Outside of research, I enjoy spending most of my free time outdoors, making the most of California's beautiful landscapes. I love hiking, rock climbing, and camping, but I'm always open to trying any outdoor activity. Photography, especially capturing people and landscapes, is another hobby of mine. During winter,
                         when outdoor activities are less accessible, I enjoy attending performances and plays in Southern California. One of my favorite experiences was watching the first synopsis of the ballet <a href="https://www.abt.org/ballet/woolf-works/" target="_blank">Woolf Works</a> last February.

                        When indoors, I enjoy writing, often just for myself. I’ve also written articles for the Computer Engineering Department magazine at Amirkabir University of Technology during my undergraduate years. As an aspiring chef, I love experimenting with new recipes inspired by traditional Persian dishes—pennyroyal is my favorite ingredient to work with.
